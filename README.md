# Aqua

Aqua turns the Mattel Aquarius into a respectable computer by adding 32 KB of RAM and SD card mass storage.

The Mattel Aquarius home computer was released in June of 1983 and had already been discontinued by October of that same year.  The short lifespan of this machine is no big surprise â€” it is equipped with 4 KB of RAM, which is reduced to 1.7 KB of free RAM after factoring in the reserved video memory and system variables.  It also has a terrible rubber chicklet keyboard that is not quite large enough for adult hands.  But despite these (and many more!) flaws, beyond all reason, I still love this computer so I wanted to give mine a little help.  By adding 32 KB of additional memory it is much more usable, and the SD card reader allows me to write software on a modern machine, then easily load it onto the Aquarius, which means I don't have to try to type in long programs on its awful keyboard (or use the cassette port, which is slow and fails far more than it succeeds).
